battle royales
FPS Games - call of duty ssame game practically every year and a significant lack of content
Assasins creed games - dry ruined movement and new combat is boring

survival / story game - natural weather is scaled up X50 i.e. wind is hurricanes, 
sun burns, rain results in floods etc. a game exploring how a human may adapt in this sort of scenario. post apocolyptic settings

pshycological horror game in which the player has ptsd goes from normal setting to upscaling.
the player is introduced to the chararacter in a regular environmnt in which the first 15-30 mins the player carries out a series of every day 
 tasks. When a loud noise occurs the player is transported into a horror like environment which includes elements such as dark noises ominous
sounds etc.
(Potential idea - The player has a meter which display the amount of stress that the character is feeling and 
when it is maxed out it goes into "Horror mode")

horror game you play as an animal and are being hunted by humans
