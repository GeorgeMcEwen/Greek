story writing
main protagonist must have a character arc

1st act - introduction to the characters / main protagonist 

2nd act - player is faced with challenges or bumps which 
results in character growth and the story becomes more intense as the player becomes more skillful

3rd act - resolution of the story or ends in suspense which could result in later stories etc.
character gains a new understanding and in general is morally better depending on the style of narrative
(some stories dont result in the traditional happy ending).

end of the story should reveal the overall meaning or point. ending the story arch if a standalone story.

Digital storytelling:
is much more immersive as the player has control and can be affected by the player.
furthermore the story and depth of characters can be pushed through non cinematic audio cues that are played
by the players companions which overall improves the depth of the characters and story.

have a purpose and dont rely on traditional tropes.
